# FIRM
Fantasy Item Resource Management

The goal of FIRM is to provide a clean, simple item-management system to be utilized in building digital pen & paper RPG applications. The idea behind it is to build repositories of items, and to utilize them from within a campaign workspace. They are placed into a repository for the campaign, and linked back to the master repository. In the event the master repo is updated, the campaign's item can either be updated as well, or keep its version. This allows for infinite customization within a single campaign. This works for characters (NPC's, named or generic) as well.

This also allows for system-based repositories to be created and to be able to import/export between those into custom repos. e.g. Pathfinder weapons being used in 5e campaigns.
